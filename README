For UNIX systems:

In order to run the BCK applications, you should add the following to your
~/.cshrc file
assuming that the BCK directory is located at:
/home/users/me/BCK

1. Amend the PATH entry so that it includes /home/users/me/BCK/bin
2. Amend the CLASSPATH entry so that it includes 
/home/users/me/BCK/classes
and
/home/users/me/BCK/classes/swingall.jar

Secondly, you must edit the 'bck' script in the BCK/bin directory so that it reads:


java -DBCK.home=/home/users/me/BCK/classes/BCK/GUI/ -mx100m -oss1m -ss1m -ms10m BCK.GUI.bck

now type:

source ~/.cshrc
rehash

and to run the application type

bck


For windows systems:

Amend the CLASSPATH and PATH environment variables as described for UNIX, with the dos 'set' command or equivalent in the autoexec.bat file.
amend the bck.bat file in the BCK/bin directory in the manner described for the
bck script in UNIX above
to run the Brain Construction Kit type 

bck
